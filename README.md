# Welcome to my GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Jessie, a former investment banker turned software engineer. I made the leap into the tech world seeking a career that would keep me engaged and challenged on a daily basis.

## About Me
As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, an immigrant, and a first-generation college graduate, I bring a diverse perspective to everything I do.

## My Journey
Reflecting on my career, I found the most joy in automating tasks using Python and Excel Macros. This sparked my passion for coding and ultimately led me to transition into software engineering. From contributing to a scavenger hunt [website](https://100ways.sendchinatownlove.com/) aimed to promote local small businesses to my passion project [Misfit](https://www.misfit.fashion/), a place for the transgender community to share clothing and style recommendations, I am excited that programming has allowed me to make the world a better place by creating websites and tools for marginalized and often forgotten communities.

## Technologies I've Explored
I've explored a wide range of technologies and languages including:
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- **Technologies:** React.js, Next.js, React-Redux, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Selenium, Jest, AWS S3, Fluent UI

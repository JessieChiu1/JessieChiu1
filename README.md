# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Jessie.

I'm an investment banker turned software engineer. I decided to pursue a different career path because I was really bored at my job. I've always wanted a career where I could learn every day and challenge myself consistently.

Looking back at my career, I really enjoyed my time automating tasks via Python and Excel Macros. This was the most fun I had at any job, and this experience inspired me to switch careers.

# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Jessie!
I'm an investment banker turned software engineer. I decided to pursue a different career path because I was really bored at my job. I've always wanted a career where I could learn every day and challenge myself consistently.

Looking back at my career, I really enjoyed my time automating tasks via Python and Excel Macros. This was the most fun I had at any job, and this experience inspired me to switch careers.

### Iâ€™m currently learning:
I am currently learning DSA and undergoing the 100 Days of Code: Python course on Udemy. You can view my progress <a href="https://github.com/JessieChiu1/Angela_Yu_Python">here</a> 

### I've dabbled in:
TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Firebase, PostgreSQL, pandas, smtplib, Twilio, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
